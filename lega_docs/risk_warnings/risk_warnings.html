            <h2>1. PURPOSE OF OUR PROGRAM</h2>
            <p>We have established and implemented an Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorist Financing, and Trade & Economic Sanctions Program ("AML/ATF/Sanctions Program" or "Program") to ensure a robust and compliant digital asset trading platform.

            <h2>3. REGULATORY LANDSCAPE</h2>
            <p>We understand that regulatory bodies have taken a diverse approach to the laws and regulations regarding Digital Assets, including some characterizing or defining Digital Assets as convertible virtual currency (by USA FinCEN) or virtual commodity (by Hong Kong). As a trading platform, we believe that all Digital Assets available on CONVEXO Platform are an innovative alternative asset class; and therefore, Digital Assets should not be called currency or money.</p>

            <h2>4. OUR AML/ATF PROGRAM</h2>
            <p>We have designed our Program to reasonably prevent money laundering and terrorist financing through a risk-based, multi-layer control system.</p>
            
            <p>The first layer includes a stringent customer identification program, including verifying the identity of our customers, whether individuals or entities. In addition to obtaining identification documents, we obtain for non-natural persons their entities' beneficial owners/natural persons consistent to international standards such as the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).</p>
            
            <p>The second layer includes a risk-based system to warrant additional customer due diligence. To accomplish this, we screen our customers (including beneficial owners) against various government-provided lists of sanctioned individuals and entities.</p>
            
            <p>The third layer includes ongoing monitoring for suspicious activity. If our Program suspects or has reason to suspect suspicious activities have occurred, we will file suspicious activities reports with local regulators.</p>
